\title{A simulated methylation dataset based on a real data.}
\format{
A data frame of 6064 rows and 13 columns. Each row represents a CpG
site for a sample. Columns include in order:
\describe{
\item{Meth_Counts}{Number of methylated reads}
\item{Total_Counts}{Total number of reads; read-depth}
\item{Position}{Genomic position (in bp) for the CpG site}
\item{ID}{indicates which sample the CpG site belongs to}
\item{ACPA4}{binary indicator for a biomarker anti-citrullinated protein
antibody}
\item{Age}{Age}
\item{Sex}{2-female; 1-male}
\item{Smoking}{1-current or ex-smoker; 0-non-smoker}
\item{Smoking_NA}{1-Smoking info is NA; 0-Smoking info is available}
\item{PC1}{PC1 for the cell type proportions}
\item{PC2}{PC2 for the cell type proportions}
\item{PC3}{PC3 for the cell type proportions}
\item{PC4}{PC4 for the cell type proportions}
